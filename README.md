# Sentiment_Sorting

In order to use this data, one should first download all of the .csv files and the .py file into your Downloads folder, which will serve as the data from which the code will execute. 
In order to run the data, open up the python file "Sentiment Sorting", preferably in Jupyter Notebook. If the csv files were not downloaded into the Downloads folder,
then changing the location will be required. Next, execute the code by running it in Jupyter Notebook. The code should execute and the results should appear. Just in case the main() does not execute,
I have specifed in the code that the results should print out. The resulting companies with the strongest poles, according to the sentiment analysis should appear. 
There should be three companies with equally lowest scores and one with the highest score. The top 10 most common words should also appear, with "for" being the most common.
